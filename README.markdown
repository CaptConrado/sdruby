# SD Ruby #

This app serves as the web home of SD Ruby, a local Ruby user group, based in San Diego, CA.

Currently, the app includes support for video podcasts, member profiles, and a Github project list. We're also working on adding a job board and other features.

Other Ruby groups should feel free to use this code as the basis for their group website.

### Podcast ###

Thanks to UCSD, we're able to record SD Ruby meetings, and publish our talks as a video podcast.

Member profiles can include:
- Full name
