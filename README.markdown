This app is the website of [SD Ruby](http://sdruby.org), a local Ruby user group based in San Diego, CA.

Currently, this application includes support for our video podcast, member signup and registration, member profiles, and a Github project list. We're also working on adding a job board and other features.

## Features ##

### Podcast ###

Thanks to UCSD, we're able to record SD Ruby meetings, and publish our talks as a [video podcast](http://sdruby.org/podcast).

The podcast code can generate both an Atom feed and an RSS feed (with custom iTunes RSS extensions).

### Member Guide ###

The [member guide](http://sdruby.org/users) contains a list of all SD Ruby members.

Member profiles can include:

* Full name
* Avatar image
* Github ID
* Neighborhood
* Ruby experience
* Work availability 
* Contact email (if public)

### Project List ###

The [list of projects](http://sdruby.org/projects) shows all Github projects created by SD Ruby members.
