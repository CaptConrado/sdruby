# SD Ruby app #

We're working on this app in a few phases.

In the first phase, we'll update the site design and merge the podcast site into the main website. In the second phase, we'll work towards adding support for calendaring and podcast workflows. Then, we'll work on abstracting this project into something other groups can use.

Here's a breakdown of the first phase.

### Tasks ###

- Unfreeze Rails
- Update plugins
- Update the app to Rails 2.2.2
- Switch gems to use config.gem
- Create new podcast model and controller
- Create Rake task to import old podcast data
- Markup new pages (homepage, podcast homepage, and podcast detail)
- Style new pages (homepage, podcast homepage, and podcast detail)
