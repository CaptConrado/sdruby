# SD Ruby 2.0 #

We're working on this app in a few phases.

In the first phase, we'll update the site design and merge the podcast site into the main website. In the second phase, we'll work towards adding support for calendaring and podcast workflows. Then, we'll work on abstracting this project into something other groups can use.
