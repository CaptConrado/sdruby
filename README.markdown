# SD Ruby #

This app serves as the web home of SD Ruby, a local Ruby user group based in San Diego, CA.

Currently, this application includes support for our video podcast, member signup and registration, member profiles, and a Github project list. We're also working on adding a job board and other features.

If you belong to another Ruby group, feel free to fork this code as the basis for your group's website.

### Podcast ###

Thanks to UCSD, we're able to record SD Ruby meetings, and publish our talks as a video podcast.

The podcast code can generate both an Atom feed and an RSS feed (with custom iTunes RSS extensions).

Member profiles can include:
